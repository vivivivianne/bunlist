# 🐇BunArr - A simple c99 dynamic array implementation


## ✅ Features and Usage:
- The code is overly commented with the usage explained in it.
- Set a initial capacity to avoid unnecessary memory reallocations.
- Control array growth once it reaches max size (linear and geometric progression).
- use bunarr_exe() to run a function on all the items of the array.
- bunarr_free() destroys the array.
- to use simply copy the headers and bunarr.c


## ⚠️  Caveats:

- Not made with double pointers in mind, might not work.
- it also requires buntypes.h which is what i personally use for types.


## 🗒️ Todo:
- Clear reduntant code into less functions
